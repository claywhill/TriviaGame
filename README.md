This app is a simple quiz-style trivia game that ends after all questions have been answered or the timer runs out.

The app uses standard front end languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript(jQuery). The objective was to implement the use of an interval countdown timer.

To use the app simply click the start button and attempt to answer all the question before the time runs out. An option to play again will be given after each attempt.
